# RespawnSMP
Made for Finally Finished's Minecraft SMP. Open sourced to add to my portfolio, and to prove to him its not backdoor'ed, and I can actually make something cool. Feel free to look around, modify it, or just download the jar from the releases tab on the side.

**NOTE:** Please don't publish my stuff on SpigotMC, if one of your friends asks for the plugin, please just send them here, Thanks - Fluyd.
